# 🗂️ File Organizer — Python Automation

A Python automation tool that instantly sorts a messy folder into organized subfolders by file extension - built using the `os` and `shutil` libraries.

## 💡 The Real Scenario

You're an IT administrator. Your manager asks you to find the **database file** from a shared folder.

You open the folder and find **941 mixed files**:

```
photo_1.jpg, movie.avi, script.py, backup.zip, song.mp3,
report.pdf, employees.db, animation.swift, archive.rar ...
```

❌ **Without the organizer** — you scroll through 941 files trying to spot the database file. Takes forever. Easy to miss.

✅ **With the organizer** — run the script. Files are sorted instantly:

```
My_Files/
├── Database/
│   └── database file   ← found in 1 second
├── Images/
├── Videos/
├── Documents/
├── Code/
└── ...
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Generate the demo folder
Run `Creating_files.py` to instantly create 941 mixed files:
```bash
python Creating_files.py
```

### Step 2: The challenge
Your manager asks you to contact the HR recruiter urgently. The database is somewhere in that folder — find it, open it, and look up **Doroteo Arnaiz's email**.



Open `Generated_Files/` — good luck finding it among 941 files. 😅

### Step 3: Run the organizer
```bash
python File_organizer.py
```

### Step 4: Try again
Open `Generated_Files/Database/` — it's right there. 🎯

### Step 5: 🔐 Bonus challenge
Found the email? Send a message to **Doroteo Arnaiz** and mention the **passkey** you found in the database. Let's see if you really looked closely. 👀

💡 To open the database file, you'll need a tool like SQLite Viewer (VS Code extension) — just search for it in the Extensions tab and install it.

## 🐢 Want to Watch It Happen in Slow Motion?

The code includes two commented lines that add a 0.5s delay between each file move — so you can visually watch each file being organized one by one.

To enable it, uncomment these two lines in `File_organizer.py`:

```python
# import time        ← uncomment this (line 3)
# time.sleep(0.5)    ← uncomment this (inside the loop)
```
